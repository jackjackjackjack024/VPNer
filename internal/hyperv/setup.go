// The VM setup (packages, desktop, VPN program) runs in a script of its own,
// vpner-setup, started by a systemd unit rather than by cloud-init directly:
//
//   - it is retried by itself (10 minutes after a failure, and at every boot)
//     until it has succeeded once, so a step that failed because the network
//     was slow or apt was busy does not leave the VM half set up for good;
//   - it writes its state to SetupStateFile, which the gateway agent reports
//     to VPNer, so a failure is shown with its reason instead of being lost
//     when cloud-init forgets it at the next boot.
//
// Lessons from Debian 13 on Hyper-V, each of which broke the setup before:
//   - packages are installed only if the repository has them: one missing
//     name (policykit-1 is gone in Debian 13) made apt install nothing;
//   - apt waits for the dpkg lock: unattended-upgrades holds it at first boot;
//   - files go to directories that may not exist yet (write_files makes them);
//   - Xorg needs a Device section for the Hyper-V video card and no vga16fb.

// SetupStateFile holds "running", "done" or "error <code>" (SetupErr*).
